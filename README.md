# Facial_Plan
Face Recognition Using raspberry Pi and deep learning

---


The motto of this project is create a facial recognition model using deep learning on raspberry pi.

The main focus is to create a very robust dynamic model which can identify the face real-time with real time speed and with high accuracy. This repository contains the most cleaned code(Few of experiments are available but most are cleaned)

The frame work used in this project are tflearn(abstracted-tensorflow) and keras using tensorflow backend. 

Looking forward for implemnetation using all multiprocessing option of tensorflow
